# formula-eval
Evaluates and resolves arithmetic expressions.

⚒️ Under construction ⚒️

It takes a formula in a string format, parses it to an abstract syntax tree (AST) and evaluates the tree to calculate the resulting value.

The process is based on recursion and on the AST logic, which lead to challanges like mental debugging and the organization of the AST nodes in the wright order so the resulting value is also correct.
